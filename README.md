Reflection: What are the significant software concepts that this combination of technologies has that plain HTML, CSS, and JS does not? Or that they handle significantly differently?

This combination of technologies uses a database so that the data the user adds is stored somewhere not just locally. Then, there are get and post requests made to update the data in the database when needed. EJS is different than JS because it lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.
